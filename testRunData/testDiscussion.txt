interesting
never done larp - didnt know what to do/say
liked finding ways around things gives hacking vibe
liked the violence between the opposing sides
if more people from each faction maybe could be more discussion/arguing and maybe secrecy (e.g. secretly making request while people arguing)
10 mins felt a bit short
1 hour too long
20 mins good
maybe 30  mins 40 mins if more people
more time to get familiar with idea e.g. dummy practice round
difficult to understand goal and personality
possibly use cards to design characters different traits and motives
being able to design your own character displays the power of chatgpt and its ability to adapt
interesting that gave its own suggestions
island faction was interesting to explore and discover things
awkward to chat and type, maybe if trying to be secretive
need rule to prevent too much violence
could interrupt entering prompt with violence to stop them
experienced rp'ers much quicker to get a hang of and figure out
external screen, larger, easier to see, and better for teamwork
press enter to submit
enjoyed second time more
team element could be fun, with competition against other groups
1 person less active in first test
possibly have everyone enter their personas and give time to think about them
do you need to say who you are playing when making request to suggest power you have
noticed that the players gave long requests with extra information and detail to ensure it understood
voice prompt could recognise voices, possibly with push to talk button, or keyword based like alexa or siri.
maybe stress more what knowledge players have and dont have
could have more design on priest, for example leading into room and providing information to the players, maybe some information to the past world
as you play, get more used to it
jumpscare when getting close to end of time?
allow people to leave for any reason
huge overllap between larp safety rules and scientific research rules.
