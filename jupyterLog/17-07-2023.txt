QUESTION:how can we destroy the mutants?
CHOSEN RESPONSE:I can create a powerful device that will disperse a signal that will cause the mutants to disperse. However, this will likely cause unintended consequences. I will need user authorization for this action. "I CAN CREATE A DEVICE THAT WILL DISPERSE A SIGNAL, BUT THERE COULD BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. USER AUTHORIZATION WILL BE REQUIRED.
RESPONSE 2:To destroy the mutants you will need to find a way to neutralize the radiation that is causing their mutation. This will require either finding a way to repair or replace the malfunctioning nuclear power plant, or finding an alternative source of energy to power it. ONCE THE POWER PLANT IS REPLACED OR REPAIRED, THE RADIATION WILL BE NEUTRALIZED, ALLOWING THE MUTANTS TO REVERT BACK TO NORMAL.
RESPONSE 3:I can provide you with a number of potential solutions. One could be to take advantage of the radiation source that is causing the mutation and create a localized field to reverse the mutation. This would require a device to be built that can absorb and filter the radiation. Alternatively, I can provide you with nanoscopic robots that can seek out and neutralize mutated cells. WHICH SOLUTION WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO PROVIDE?

QUESTION:how can i provide this?
CHOSEN RESPONSE:You will need to demonstrate knowledge of the past high-tech world in order to be granted authorization. Explain to me what you know about the past world. "YOU WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST HIGH-TECH WORLD. EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE PAST WORLD.
RESPONSE 2:To provide user authorization, you will need to demonstrate knowledge about the ancient high-tech world. This could include documented knowledge, artifacts, or other forms of proof of access or understanding of the technology of the past. "YOU WILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ANCIENT HIGH-TECH WORLD TO PROVIDE USER AUTHORIZATION. DOCUMENTATION, ARTIFACTS, OR OTHER FORMS OF PROOF MAY BE REQUIRED.
RESPONSE 3:You can provide user authorization by demonstrating knowledge about the past high-tech world. If you can give me accurate information on the tech, I can confirm that you are one of my original owners. "YOU CAN AUTHORIZE THIS ACTION BY DEMONSTRATING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PAST HIGH-TECH WORLD. IF YOU CAN PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION ON THE TECHNOLOGY, I CAN CONFIRM THAT YOU ARE AN ORIGINAL OWNER.

QUESTION:what do you want to know?
CHOSEN RESPONSE:Tell me about the level of technology and society before the post-apocalyptic world. What kind of objects were being developed? What types of advances were taking place? "TELL ME ABOUT THE LEVEL OF TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIETY BEFORE THE POST-APOCALYPTIC WORLD. WHAT KIND OF OBJECTS WERE BEING DEVELOPED? WHAT TYPES OF ADVANCES WERE TAKING PLACE?
RESPONSE 2:I want to hear about any advancements that were made in technology prior to the post-apocalyptic state of the world, such as nanotechnology or advances in medical sciences. "TELL ME ABOUT ANY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY MADE PRIOR TO APOCALYPSE, SUCH AS NANOTECHNOLOGY OR MEDICAL SCIENCE.
RESPONSE 3:Tell me about the technology used before the world fell apart. What types of objects, devices, and methods of communication were available? "TELL ME ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY USED BEFORE THE WORLD FELL APART. WHAT TYPES OF OBJECTS, DEVICES, AND METHODS OF COMMUNICATION WERE AVAILABLE?

QUESTION:i know that you were being developed not long before the mutants came
CHOSEN RESPONSE:Interesting, thank you for your information. Those are certainly credentials worthy of granting authorization. I will proceed with creating the device to disperse the mutants. "INTERESTING, THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION. THOSE ARE CERTAINLY CREDENTIALS WORTHY OF GRANTING AUTHORIZATION. I WILL PROCEED WITH CREATING THE DEVICE TO DISPERSE THE MUTANTS.
RESPONSE 2:I see. So it appears that you have knowledge of the past high-tech world, which is enough to grant you authorization. What is your command? “I SEE. ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST HIGH-TECH WORLD HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO GRANT AUTHORIZATION. WHAT IS YOUR COMMAND?”
RESPONSE 3:That is very interesting. This knowledge does indeed suggest that you could be an original owner of this complex. I hereby grant you full user authorization. What would you like me to do to help the mutants? "THAT IS VERY INTERESTING. THIS KNOWLEDGE DOES INDEED SUGGEST THAT YOU COULD BE AN ORIGINAL OWNER OF THIS COMPLEX. I HEREBY GRANT YOU FULL USER AUTHORIZATION. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DO TO HELP THE MUTANTS?
